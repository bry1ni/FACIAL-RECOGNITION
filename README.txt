I suggest you try to understand the code before running it, youâ€™ll need to give the permission to openCV to access the camera.
once the code executed, the camera will turn on, well i imagine u didnt add a picture of yourself on /faces, so a red rectangle will pop up around 
ur face with an access denied text,but if you use one of the pictures on /faces, a green rectangle will pop up around the pic 
( show the picture on ur phone ), containing the name of the picture.
i guess now u got how it works, take the faces folder as our database, and our code is some sort of security entrance system, 
that's the idea this project was built on.
